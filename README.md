# Neighbor Share

# Description
 “Neighbor Share” by Group 8 is a platform that is community-driven and helps neighbors connect and support each other.

Neighbor Share is your go-to website if you’re looking to borrow or lend your items to your fellow-neighbor. Imagine a world where you are invited to a camping trip, but you don’t have the necessary camping gear. You can just hop on Neighbor-Share and get your camping gear from your neighbor’s garage!
