# Neighbor Share

## Description
 “Neighbor Share” by Group 8 is a platform that is community-driven and helps neighbors connect and support each other.

Neighbor Share is your go-to website if you’re looking to borrow or lend your items to your fellow-neighbor. Imagine a world where you are invited to a camping trip, but you don’t have the necessary camping gear. You can just hop on Neighbor-Share and get your camping gear from your neighbor’s garage!

## User Story

AS A neighbor

I WANT to communicate with people within the neighborhood

SO THAT I can borrow items within my community.

## Acceptance Criteria

AS A Neighbor who wants to borrow and share items within my community,

WHEN I enter my address,

THEN I get a map within five miles of my address.

WHEN I get a map,

THEN I get a unique ID.

WHEN I get a unique ID that defines my space,

THEN I can share it with my neighbors and use it for future access.

WHEN I load the page with my unique ID,

THEN I am provided with listings that match items in my neighborhood.

## Usage

Open the page at [https://donnyandre29.github.io/Neighbor-Share/](https://donnyandre29.github.io/Neighbor-Share/)

To see content from Flickr API on the index page, enter in the "demo" key in the text entry box labelled "Enter your key": **happy-82ay9J5**

When results load, a filter bar should appear where you can select which category you would like to view.

Click on "Get Started" to see the Google Maps interface. When you enter an address, a key should appear on the page as well as in local storage if you open the console. There is a "Share with Neighbors" button that should appear. When you click on that button, a modal opens up with a custom generated message to share with neighbors.
