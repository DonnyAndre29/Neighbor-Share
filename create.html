            What if - instead of buying or renting all of those items - you could just reach out to your neighbors to

Hi Neighbor! This is [Your name]! I just set up a new neighbor lending space at Neighbor Share. 

You will be able to borrow and lend all sorts of items exclusively with our neighbors. You can access it using the passcode below. 

Please feel free to share with anybody in the neighborhood!
